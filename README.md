8. General public.

> This is adapted from our [user taxonomy](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/wiki/Taxonomie-des-utilisateurs). Prioritisation is made according to the distribution of active users in August 2017, to minimise the risk of targeting an audience where offer is inadequate.


## Conversion funnels

## Metrics

- **Correlated homepage bounce rate & time spent**: measure bounce occurrences where time spent is less than needed to read the value proposition and use this metric to optimise acquisition channels.
- **Newsletter subscriptions**: measure acquisition rate and use this metric to optimise activation channels.
- **API calls**: measure API calls and use this metric to optimise the experimentation process.
- **Contribution rate**: measure the issue-, PR- and email- reception ratios to homepage visits and use this metric to optimise the conversion funnels.
